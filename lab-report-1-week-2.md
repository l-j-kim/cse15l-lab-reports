This is a tutorial to set up remote access to ieng6.

Installing VScode
---
The first step in this process is installing VS Code, which can be done by clicking on this [link](https://code.visualstudio.com/Download). 

The link should bring you to the page below, where you can download the correct version of VS Code for your computer's operation system.

Once it is done downloading, follow the instructions on the installer and open VS Code. The starting window should look something like the image below.

Remotely Connecting
---
On VS Code, toggle the integrated terminal using the navigation bar on the bottom. Using the terminal, type the command, `$ ssh username@ieng6.ucsd.edu` where "username" is your class specific username.

 If you get a message similar to `"the authenticity of host ieng6.ucsd.edu can't be established, are you sure you want to continue connecting?"`, say yes. Type in your password into the terminal to complete the login process, and your terminal display should look something like the image below.
